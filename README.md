Final project for the intro to HTML/CSS Odin Project coursework.

I'm filling out this ReadMe after finishing the project as opposed to before so that I can reflect on it. I felt like I understood the concepts I picked up in this section quite well before going into this, so I wasn't exactly overwhelmed by the task. It was more just daunting knowing how much content I would be making.

I made sure to start off creating the entire HTML structure of the page first, like Odin suggested, so I wouldn't be switching back and forth the whole time. Then I began to add basic CSS to each section one by one until the entire page was laid out somewhat like it needed to be. I then when back in and spent a lot of time refining all the minor details so the site looked and behaved (almost exactly) like I wanted it to. 

One thing I discovered was the ability to set the width of an element, but then set the margins of it as a percentage, so when you shrunk the viewframe, the element shrunk somewhat proportionally to the edges of vf instead of bumping up against it. I'm sure this is something that'll be covered more extensively when I dive into responsive design, but it was a cool little hack I thought I'd try here. 

The entire thing took me about two hours, but I didn't feel like that long at all. It was a really fun and fulfilling puzzle to put together!

Intro to HTML + CSS complete! Now onto Javascript... yikes.
